Paul Armstrong

This role is designed to manage a list of known content views in a foreman or Satellite configuration and publish each of the content views.
In this role you are allowed to manage a Errata-by-date rule and update the enddate so that you can configure periodic publishing of new content views. 
The example situation is that you are managing a series of content views for monthly publishing. You can manage the frequency of publishing by managing the scheduling frequency of the play. The play variable just specifies the enddate of the inclusion rule. You can create different jobs that include different variables for the list of content views and the target lifecycle environments.
